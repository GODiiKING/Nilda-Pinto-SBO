<!--What I learned-->
## What I learned
Since this is a school project I had to self-taught myself the basics of HTML and CSS by surfing website templates designed by YouTube for ideas for what I could do by using concepts from How To Make Website Using [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) & [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/) | Full Responsive Multi Page Website Design Step by Step from [GreatStack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYRda7UtuhA&list=PLjwm_8O3suyP5kGKmwS_DM0Hs1j7fshi5&index=1).
