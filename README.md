Had to [build a Nilda Pinto SBO website](https://nildapinto-sbo.weebly.com/) using the school assignment assets only.
Only using HTML and CSS. This is my first-ever project. In which we have 100% creativity in design and code.

# About Me
I'm a Junior Web Developer and used to be in [MBO Niveau 3](https://www.government.nl/topics/secondary-vocational-education-mbo-and-tertiary-higher-education/secondary-vocational-education-mbo), Employee Management (ICT) at Nilda Pinto SBO from 2020 - 2022...

## :mortar_board: What I learned
Since this is a school project I had to self-taught myself the basics of HTML and CSS by surfing website templates designed by YouTube for ideas for what I could do by using concepts from How To Make Website Using [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) & [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/) | Full Responsive Multi Page Website Design Step by Step from [GreatStack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYRda7UtuhA&list=PLjwm_8O3suyP5kGKmwS_DM0Hs1j7fshi5&index=1).
